Research topic: Discover the relationship between the Federal Funds Effective Rate（also known as the US interest rate), the private sector lending and borrowing amount, M2, consumer loans, and CPI, ranging from 2005 to 2022.

The Federal Funds Effective Rate is a worldwide focused economic indicator. The increase of the US interest rate may lead to the inflow of capital into the US, therefore foreign countries monitor and forecast the movements of the US Federal Funds rate in order to be prepared for the inflow and outflow of capital in their own countries in order stabilize their economy. We listed a few US economic factors that may have a relationship and impact on the Federal Funds Rate, the FED makes decisions based on domestic and foreign factors, and our project is to discover possible domestic factors that contribute to the decision-making of the FED.

Our data is from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis's economics research database: <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/>, we will provide detailed data sources below for each parameter.

**Federal Funds Effective Rate**: <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFF>:

Description: the Federal Funds Effective Rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions trade federal funds(balances held at Federal Reserve Banks) with each other overnight. When a depository institution has surplus balances in its reserve account, it lends to other banks in need of larger balances. In simpler terms, a bank with excess cash, which is often referred to as liquidity, will lend to another bank that needs to quickly raise liquidity. The rate that the borrowing institution pays to the lending institution is determined between the two banks; the weighted average rate for all of these types of negotiations is called the effective federal funds rate. The effective federal funds rate is essentially determined by the market but is influenced by the Federal Reserve through open market operations to reach the federal funds rate target.

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets eight times a year to determine the federal fund's target rate.

The data is collected on a 7-day frequency and not seasonally adjusted. The data is a percent number, and we are preparing to import CSV data downloaded from the link.

**Net Lending or net borrowing, Private**: <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/W994RC1Q027SBEA>

Description: the private sector net lending or borrowing data represent the market's demand for money, it is also an indicator of the market's activity level. When lending and borrowing are increasing, usually it means the economy is in a good trend, on the other hand, when the data decreases, it reflects some kind of recession.

The data is collected quarterly by the Fed, The fed collects and monitors activity from commercial banks and other financial institutions and reports with units of billions of dollars. we are preparing to import CSV data downloaded from the link.

**M2**: <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WM2NS>

Description: M2 consists of M1 plus small-denomination time deposits (time deposits in amounts of less than \$100,000) less IRA and Keogh balances at depository institutions, and balances in retail MMFs less IRA and Keogh balances at MMFs. Seasonally adjusted M2 is constructed by summing savings deposits (before May 2020), small-denomination time deposits, and retail MMFs, each seasonally adjusted separately, and adding this result to seasonally adjusted M1.

The data is collected by the Fed, and the board of governors releases M2 data in its H.6 Statistical Release. The data is collected weekly, with billions of dollars as the unit, we are preparing to import CSV data downloaded from the link.

**Consumer Loans**: <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CCLACBW027SBOG>

Description: The consumer loans, credit cards, and other revolving plans, all commercial banks provide information on the total loan demands in the market, it shows a similar function as Net Lending or net borrowing, which reflects the market's activity.

The data is collected by the Fed and the board of governors releases the data on weekly basis. The data has units of billions of dollars and we are preparing to import CSV data downloaded from the link.

**CPI**: <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEDCPIM158SFRBCLE>

Description: Median Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of core inflation calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the Ohio State University. Median CPI was created as a different way to get a 'Core CPI' measure or a better measure of underlying inflation trends. To calculate the Median CPI, the Cleveland Fed analyzes the median price change of the goods and services published by the BLS. The median price change is the price change that's right in the middle of the long list of all of the price changes. This series excludes 49.5% of the CPI components with the highest and lowest one-month price changes from each tail of the price-change distribution resulting in a Median CPI Inflation Estimate.

The data is collected by the Federal reserve bank on a monthly basis. The unit is the percent change at an annual rate, therefore the data is a percent number. We are preparing to import CSV data downloaded from the link.
