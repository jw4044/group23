# Conclusion
As we summarized in the findings, the FED is increasing the Federal Funds Effective Rate recently, and therefore we may see the SP500 go down and the spread between the 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity and 2-Year Treasury Constant Maturity goes wider. People and the capital markets may see the short-term economy negatively and choose to invest in long-term assets for stability. In this project, we learned and tested some relationships among some economic indicators. Some limitations of the project are that we did not include a lot of variables, there may be other variables that can explain the possible impact on the current variables, also all of our variables are continuous and we may pick some categorical variables in the future, for example, compare the interest rate across different countries.
