More specifically the relations among the Federal Funds Effective Rate, Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreements, 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Minus 2-Year Treasury Constant Maturity, S&amp;P 500, and the Nominal Broad U.S. Dollar Index. The most important indicator we see every day is the Federal Funds Effective Rate, we will mainly focus on discovering the fluctuation of other indicators based on the up and down of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and try to find the logic behind it. We chose the data from 2017-1-3 to 2022-1-3 for the analysis. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data Source 2.3 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic This project discovers the relationship between the Federal Funds Effective Rate（also known as the US interest rate), Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreements, 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Minus 2-Year Treasury Constant Maturity, S&amp;P 500, and the Nominal Broad U.S. Dollar Index. The Federal Funds Effective Rate is a worldwide focused economic indicator. The increase of the US interest rate may lead to the inflow of capital into the US, therefore foreign countries monitor and forecast the movements of the US Federal Funds rate in order to be prepared for the inflow and outflow of capital in their own countries in order to stabilize their economy. Also, the modification of the Federal Funds Rate may impact the capital markets’ view about the future economy, therefore it could impact other economic indicators and ultimately impact our lives. We listed a few key economic indicators that might be impacted by the Federal Funds Rate and we aim to discover its impacts on these indicators and have some sensibility about the economic world. 2.2 Data Source Our data is from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s economics research database:https://fred.stlouisfed.org/, we will provide detailed data sources below for each parameter. Federal Funds Effective Rate: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFF: Description: the Federal Funds Effective Rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions trade federal funds(balances held at Federal Reserve Banks) with each other overnight. When a depository institution has surplus balances in its reserve account, it lends to other banks in need of larger balances. In simpler terms, a bank with excess cash, which is often referred to as liquidity, will lend to another bank that needs to quickly raise liquidity. The rate that the borrowing institution pays to the lending institution is determined between the two banks; the weighted average rate for all of these types of negotiations is called the effective federal funds rate. The effective federal funds rate is essentially determined by the market but is influenced by the Federal Reserve through open market operations to reach the federal funds rate target. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets eight times a year to determine the federal fund’s target rate. The data is collected on a 7-day frequency and not seasonally adjusted. The data is a percent number, and we are preparing to import CSV data downloaded from the link. Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreements: Treasury Securities Sold by the Federal Reserve in the Temporary Open Market Operations：https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RRPONTSYD Description: A reverse repurchase agreement (known as reverse repo or RRP) is a transaction in which the New York Fed under the authorization and direction of the Federal Open Market Committee sells a security to an eligible counterparty with an agreement to repurchase that same security at a specified price at a specific time in the future. For these transactions, eligible securities are U.S. Treasury instruments, federal agency debt, and mortgage-backed securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies. The data is collected on a daily frequency and not seasonally adjusted. The data is in billions of dollars and we are preparing to import CSV data downloaded from the link. 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Minus 2-Year Treasury Constant Maturity: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y Description: This data series is calculated by subtracting the 2-Year Treasury Constant Maturity from the 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity rate. This number reflects the market’s emotion towards the economy. When the number goes up, which means the difference spreads wider, the market tends to prefer the 10-Year Treasury relative to the 2-Year Treasury rate, this indicates that the market is not confident in investing in the short term, therefore they choose to invest long term, which means the short term economy may go down. The data is collected on a daily frequency, it is a percent number and not seasonally adjusted. We are preparing to import CSV data downloaded from the link. S&amp;P 500: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SP500 The S&amp;P 500 represent the daily index value at market close. The market typically closes at 4 PM ET, except for holidays when it sometimes closes early. The index includes 500 leading companies in leading industries of the U.S. economy, which are publicly held on either the NYSE or NASDAQ and covers 75% of U.S. equities. Since this is a price index and not a total return index, the S&amp;P 500 index here does not contain dividends. It is the representation of the US equities market. The data is collected on the daily frequency and it is an index number without being seasonally adjusted. We are preparing to import CSV data downloaded from the link. 2.3 Data availability https://fred.stlouisfed.org/ https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFF https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RRPONTSYD https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SP500 https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DTWEXBGS "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources All the data we are using in this project is collected by the Research Department at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. They collect data from both the public and the private sectors. These data are reported by the Board of Governors, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Census—among others. The data collected ranges from international to national to regional and they also collect non-economic data these days for cross-industry analysis. The reason I picked this data source is that the Federal Reserve Bank of St.Louis is one of the most important authorities in the world, its data is relatively more convincing and trustful than other data sources. The dataset we have is a combined version of all of the CSV files we downloaded. All variables are continuous variables, there are 5 columns and 1827 rows. The Federal Funds Effective rate is a percent number, the Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreements are in billions of dollars, the 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Minus 2-Year Treasury Constant Maturity is a percent number, the S&amp;P 500 is an index number and the Nominal Broad U.S. Dollar Index is also an index number. Since the data is from the Federal Reserve Bank of St.Louis’s database, it is overall very clean and tidy. All we did was combined all entries based on the data index. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation Our initial data has NAs as ‘#NA’ and ‘.’, therefore we transformed those to regular NAs. Other than this, the data set is very clean and does not require other cleaning or transformations. 3.3 Missing value analysis From the above plots, we can see that the Federal Funds Effective rate(DFF) and the Date variables do not have any missing values. Other variables have about 32% of data missing. From the missing pattern, we can see that all 4 variables have 562 missing values, which contribute to the main missing pattern. Pattern with only USD Index(USD) has 11 missing values, pattern with T10Y2Y, USD, and Overnight Repo missing has 9 missing values, pattern with only REPO missing has 7 missing values, pattern with SP500, T10Y2Y, and REPO has 4 missing values and in the end, pattern with SP500 and REPO missing has 1 value. The possible reason behind the 562 missing values is that those values are not on trading days. Each year, there are around 250 trading days per year, Monday to Friday, the DFF and DATE variable has all days in one year while other variables only have values from Monday to Friday. Therefore there are 562 entries missing. For these missing values, we deleted all of them. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Graphs 4.2 Possible Reasons behind the findings", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Graphs For the results of the analysis, we plotted the trend of each variable to see their pattern through the years and link possible economic situations to it. Then we plotted the ridge plots for each variable to further show their fluctuations each year. We then used a normal Q-Q plot to see if these variables are normally distributed. We then used parallel coordinates plot to take a first look at the relationship among variables, then we used correlation plots, PCA, and Linear regression plots to discover their relationship step by step. Then based on the analysis, we will induct certain logic behind these variables and summarize our findings. From the trend graph, we can observe that: Federal Funds Effective Rate: The DFF increases from 2017 to 2020 and there is a sudden drop in 2020. After 2020, the DFF remains at a relatively lower level. The Overnight Reverse Repo Agreements: The reverse REPO is the amount of money the Federal Reserve is getting back from the market. From the graph, we can see that the amount in dollars remained low before the year 2021, and starting from 2021, the amount increased tremendously. 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Minus 2-Year Treasury Constant Maturity: The T10Y2Y showed a round pattern from 2017 to 2022. It decreases from 2017 and started increasing fast since 2021. SP500: The SP500 in general has a relatively steady increase pattern. It had a sudden decrease in 2020 and quickly recovered and continued increasing. USD Index: The USD Index has a strong increase in the year 2020 and generally remains on a constant level. From the economic perspective, if the government starts to print money, then its interest rate will fall, also asset prices will go up. The overall economic activity will increase and more money will be inflow into the stock market. From our observation in the graph, 2020 is an important year, the Federal Reserve Bank started to print money to ease the impact of the pandemic. Therefore, the US interest rate started to decrease as we can see from the DFF’s trend. At the same time, the SP500 in 2020 had a strong increase at the roughly same time when the DFF decreases, there might be a correlation between them. Also, we can see that the Reverse Repo Agreements and the DFF have a reverse trend. We will look into their relationship in detail in later graphs. From the above normal QQ plots, we can see that only the USD Index is roughly following the straight line indicating only the USD Index follows the normal distribution. Then we start looking at the relationship among these variables: From the correlation graph, we observe that the 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Minus 2-Year Treasury Constant Maturity has a positive correlation with the Reverse REPO and the SP500, and a negative correlation with DFF and USD. The REPO has a positive correlation with SP500 and a negative correlation with DFF. The SP500 also has a negative correlation with DFF. For USD, we can see that it has a slightly negative relationship with T10T2Y while nearly no correlation with the others. From the parallel coordinates plot, we find that DFF and REPO have a clear sign of a cross, which confirms our findings in the correlation graph. The REPO and T10Y2Y show more one-direction lines from left to right, which means they are positively correlated, which confirms our conclusion from the correlation graph. We do not see a clear pattern of correlation with T10Y2Y&amp;SP500 and SP500&amp;USD. ## PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 ## DFF 0.51349976 -0.18383927 0.5051980 -0.2010483 0.6378681 ## REPO -0.47835577 0.08758334 0.5631093 -0.6261887 -0.2330247 ## T10Y2Y -0.49871729 -0.28810356 -0.4705739 -0.3040259 0.5953199 ## SP500 -0.50297351 0.15432971 0.4210722 0.6635186 0.3250250 ## USD 0.07610828 0.92288188 -0.1701212 -0.1864902 0.2806720 ## PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 ## [1,] -0.3491305 0.8175879 -1.571887 -1.647676 0.4761562 ## [2,] -0.3259571 0.7650869 -1.571491 -1.582256 0.4626752 ## PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 ## [1,] -1264.241 483.0359 1091.950 1295.533 701.496 ## [2,] -1260.815 483.0203 1085.736 1317.152 710.470 From the principle component biplot, we can see that SP500 and REPO have a positive correlation and are driven by one factor, The DFF is in the other direction with SP500 and REPO which means the DFF has a negative relationship with them. The USD has a 90-degree angle with SP500&amp;REPO and DFF, which indicates it has no relationship with these variables at all, this confirms our findings in the correlation graph. From the PCA plot, we cannot see the relationship between the T10Y2Y and others. Finally, the linear regression graph trip confirms the relationship between DFF and REPO, DFF, and SP500 as they all show a downward slope. 4.2 Possible Reasons behind the findings By combining the economic theory and the above relationship we found, the inducted explanation behind the above relations is the following: DFF &amp; Overnight Reverse Repo Agreements: The DFF and Reverse REPO are all decided by the Federal Reserve Bank, the lower DFF(US interest rate) means to provide the market with liquidity. The increase in Reverse REPO is an action to get money back from the market, which is an action to decrease liquidity. Therefore the above two variables have a negative correlation since they work in opposite directions. DFF &amp; SP500: The decrease of the US interest rate(DFF) will provide the market with liquidity, especially in 2020 when we see people losing their jobs, and companies at the edge of bankruptcy, the FED lowered the interest rate and provided the market with liquidity. People get covid payments, companies could easily get loans with almost 0 interest rates to keep in business. My induction on the increase of SP500 when interest rate decreases are that, not all companies and families are going to bankruptcy at that time. There are a large of amount of people and companies who received benefits from the Fed’s low-interest rate and invested the money they got into the stock market. Therefore the SP500 increased sharply when the interest rate decreased sharply. DFF and 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Minus 2-Year Treasury Constant Maturity: A possible reason why these two have a negative correlation is that, when the DFF decreases, as the stock market(SP500, NASDAQ) blooms strongly, people tend to invest in the short-term for the quick and higher return. When the interest rate starts to increase again, money will flow back to the FED from the market and the blooming of the stock market may stop, therefore people will rather invest in long-term assets. In the end, the FED is increasing the Federal Funds Effective Rate recently, and therefore we may see the SP500 go down and the spread between the 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity and 2-Year Treasury Constant Maturity goes wider. People and the capital markets may see the short-term economy negatively and choose to invest in long-term assets for stability.

People and the capital markets may see the short-term economy negatively and choose to invest in long-term assets for stability. In this project, we learned and tested some relationships among some economic indicators. Some limitations of the project are that we did not include a lot of variables, there may be other variables that can explain the possible impact on the current variables, also all of our variables are continuous and we may pick some categorical variables in the future, for example, compare the interest rate across different countries.
